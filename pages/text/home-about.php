MD Arafat Kabir completed his secondary and higher secondary education from
<b>Rajshahi Cadet College</b>, located in Sardah, Rajshahi, Bangladesh.  
He completed his S.S.C and H.S.C from Rajshahi Board with Government Scholarship.
After that he got himself admitted in the Department of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology
(<b>BUET</b>) in the session 2012-2013. 
During his undergraduate studies he participated in various national and 
international competitions. 
One of his projects won the <b>1st prize</b> in 'Health Facility' category in the IAS 
CMD Humanitarian Project Contest 2017. 
The goal of the project was to develop an EEG based digital controller for physically 
paralysed people so that they can control <b>any digital equipment</b> only by 
changing their <b>brain activity level</b>.
He conducted his undergraduate thesis on design of <b>ternary logic circuit using 
Memristor-MOS hybrid architecture</b> under the supervision
of Dr. A.B.M Harun-ur-Rashid. 
He successfully designed a simulation level circuit of 
a ternary counting unit using memristors in conjunction with CMOS transistors using 
Yakopcic Memristor model in Cadence Spectre.

After graduation, he participated in a three months industrial training on VLSI 
technology in Neural Semiconductor, a VLSI Design Center based in Bangladesh. 
In the training he was specialized in <b>ASIC verification</b>. 
<?php // with SystemVerilog, UVM</b>. ?> 
Apart from technical knowledge, he gained professional 
experience from the training.
After completing the training, he joined as a full time lecturer in the Department of 
EEE of Bangladesh University. 
In the fall of 2018, he was awarded with the <b>Doctoral Academy Fellowship</b> 
by the University of Arkansas. 
</p>

<p>
Starting from fall 2018 he joined the Department of Computer Science and Computer 
Engineering at the University of Arkansas as a Doctoral student. 
Currently, he is pursuing his PhD in VLSI Design Automation under the supervision
of Dr. Yarui Peng.
His research interests are in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and
Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) design. 
He is working on an NSF funded project  to develop tool flow for design, 
extraction, and optimization of multi-chip fan-out wafer-level-packaging 
for low-power heterogeneous systems.

//During his undergraduate studies he found his passion in <b>Computer Engineering</b>. 
//He has keen interests in programming and automation. He learned a 
//number of programming languages among which <b>Assembly, C/C++ and python</b> are his 
//favourites. His favourite operating system is <b>Arch Linux</b>.
//He spends his spare time playing with micro-controllers and exploring new 
//applications of existing technologies. As a researcher, 
//his research interests are in VLSI, Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems. In 
//his third year of undergraduate studies, he designed
//an 8-bit Computer along with it's assembler in Proteus Design Suite. He is highly 
//enthusiastic about exploring new ideas everyday and
//always looking for opportunities to broaden his <b>mind and knowledge</b>.
